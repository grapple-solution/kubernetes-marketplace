## EnRoute-OneStep Kubernetes Native API Gateway - An Envoy-Powered API Gateway
EnRoute will create enroute-demo service of type LoadBalancer which will launch a [Civo Load Balancer](https://www.civo.com/load-balancers) (at an additional charge).

[EnRoute-OneStep](https://www.getenroute.io/) is a lightweight shim on Envoy proxy that makes it extremely easy to secure and route traffic destined to microservices running inside Kubernetes Cluster.

EnRoute-OneStep can be programmed by a developer using one command. Policy Overlays provide a meschanism to Operations teams to retain control and specify shared policy.

## Getting Started

[Getting started](https://docs.getenroute.io/docs/prologue/introduction/) with EnRoute-OneStep involves running [only one command](https://docs.getenroute.io/docs/prologue/getting-started-standalone/)
