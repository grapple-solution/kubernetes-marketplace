## Bitwarden Passwordless.dev

### HTTPS

An ingress is automatically created during the application install. A certificate using cert manager and lets-encrypt is also applied automatically and registered against your Civo email address and the generated domain name.

### Post installation

You should be able to access the Web GUI once the service is up and running, once this is available please visit the [official documentation](https://docs.passwordless.dev/guide/self-hosting/configuration.html) for further setup information.
